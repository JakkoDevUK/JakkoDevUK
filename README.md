### Hi there, I'm Jakko! 👋

I'm a solo indie developer from the uk. I wield my extreme caffeine addiction into code and occasional (read: very often) logical/syntactical errors.

- I'm currently working on: **A Monogame prototype**
- I'm currently learning: **Advanced physics systems**
- Ask me about: **Game Design & Pizza Toppings**
- Fun fact: **I have restarted my current project FOUR TIMES**
